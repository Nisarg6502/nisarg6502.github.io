# specs.md — working notes for future sessions

Read this first instead of the whole codebase. Update it whenever you make a
structural decision worth remembering. Keep it short.

## What this is
Single-file static portfolio site (`index.html` — all CSS/JS inline, no build
step, deployed via GitHub Pages from `main`). Repo:
github.com/Nisarg6502/nisarg6502.github.io

Theme: redacted case-file / dossier aesthetic (paper background, mono/serif
type, redaction bar wipe effects, "exhibit"/"docket"/"file" language).

## Section order (top to bottom, matches nav)
1. Hero (`#hero`)
2. About (`#about`) — eyebrow "01 / SUBJECT"
3. Experience (`#experience`) — eyebrow "02 / RECORD" — MUST stay before Case Files
4. Case Files (`#cases`) — eyebrow "03 / EXHIBITS" — projects, see below
5. Skills (`#skills`) — eyebrow "04 / INDEX"
6. Achievements (`#records`) — eyebrow "05 / ADDITIONAL RECORDS"
7. Contact (`#contact`) — eyebrow "06 / REQUEST ACCESS"

User explicitly wants Record (experience) before Case Files. Don't reorder
without asking.

## Adding a new project (case file)
Case files are a horizontal carousel (`#caseViewport` > `#caseTrack` >
`.case-file-entry` slides, one visible at a time, switched via tabs in
`#caseTabs` + prev/next arrows + a "NN / NN" counter). To add one:
1. Duplicate a `.case-tab-btn` inside `#caseTabs`, bump `data-case` index
   and the letter/name shown.
2. Duplicate a `.case-file-entry` inside `#caseTrack`, bump `data-case` to
   match and the exhibit letter. Fill in `.case-name`, `.case-desc`
   paragraphs, and `.spec-sheet` rows. Omit `.demo-box` entirely if the
   project has no interactive demo — only the Llama/PII project has one.
3. Nothing else to touch — the carousel JS (search "case carousel" in the
   `<script>` block) reads entry/tab count from the DOM automatically.

External links (GitHub, HF, etc.) go in the `LINKS` object near the top of
the `<script>` block, then reference by element id like the existing
`ghLink`/`hfLink`/`cpGhLink` pattern — give new link spans unique ids since
ids must be unique per page.

## Design tokens
All in `:root` at top of `<style>`: `--paper`, `--ink`, `--accent` (rust red),
spacing scale `--s1`..`--s7`, fonts `--serif`/`--sans`/`--mono`. Reuse these,
don't hardcode new colors/spacing.

## Conventions
- No build tooling. Everything inline in `index.html`. Keep it that way
  unless the file becomes genuinely unwieldy (it's ~1300 lines now, fine).
- `.reveal` class + IntersectionObserver = scroll-in fade/slide, used on
  most section content blocks.
- `.spotlight` class = radial cursor-follow hover glow, used on cards.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — every animation added must have a
  reduced-motion fallback in the media query near the end of `<style>`.
- Screen loader (`#loader`) shows on every load, dossier-themed ("Compiling
  dossier…"), min ~650ms display, hides on `window.load` + `document.fonts.ready`,
  4s hard fallback so it can never get stuck. Hero content (`.hero-inner > *`)
  fades in staggered right after loader closes, via `body.loaded` class.

## Known environment quirk (not a code bug)
The in-session browser preview tool's screenshot/zoom sometimes hangs and
IntersectionObserver doesn't fire on programmatic (non-real) scrolls in that
tool. Verified via `get_page_text`/`read_page`/manual `dispatchEvent('scroll')`
that the actual reveal/nav-sync logic works correctly — it's a tooling
limitation, not a site bug. Don't waste time chasing it again; just verify
via DOM queries instead of screenshots if it recurs.

## Open items
- Counterpoint (Exhibit B) has no live demo yet (not deployed). No "Live
  demo"/"Live app" spec row was added for it — add one + wire a URL into
  `LINKS` when it's deployed.
- Resume PDF (`Nisarg Kudgunti Resume.pdf`) is the source of truth for work
  experience wording — when it's updated again, diff it against the docket
  section bullets in `#experience`.

## Session log
- 2026-07-13: Removed the floating background token-particle canvas
  animation (hero). Reordered sections (Record before Case Files).
  Restructured Case Files section to support multiple project entries
  (`.case-file-entry` + `.exhibit-tag`, currently only Exhibit A / Llama
  PII redactor filled in). Replaced meaningless "PERSONNEL FILE NO. 0150M"
  hero tag with "FILE STATUS: ACTIVE — OPEN TO OFFERS". Added themed screen
  loader + staggered hero entrance animation. Removed dead `.redact-hint`
  CSS (was unused in markup). Added `.gitignore` and this file.
- 2026-07-13 (later): Replaced resume PDF with updated version; synced
  `#experience` docket bullets to match it (AI Intern bullets rewritten,
  Associate AI Engineer's last two bullets reworded/merged). Added Exhibit B
  case file: Counterpoint (corporate contradiction detector over SEC
  filings — LangGraph agentic hybrid RAG, Neo4j, Qdrant). Added Langfuse tag
  to AI systems and Qdrant/Neo4j tags to Data, matching resume + new
  project's stack.
- 2026-07-13 (again): Wired Counterpoint's GitHub URL into `LINKS`. Reworked
  Case Files from a vertical stack (was making the page too long) into a
  horizontal carousel — one exhibit visible at a time, tabs + prev/next
  arrows + "NN / NN" counter, viewport height animates to match the active
  slide. Filled the previously-empty hero right column with a static
  `.hero-visual` dossier-stamp card (redacted-line mockup + exhibit/role
  stat counts) — no motion beyond a one-time fade-in, per "no floating
  stuff" from earlier. Redesigned `.index-card` (skills section): ghost
  watermark number, two-letter category code badge, hover lift + shadow —
  was flagged as "too bland."
